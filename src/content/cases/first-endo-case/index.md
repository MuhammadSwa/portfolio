  - "A suspected apical split was encountered during instrumentation. To investigate this anatomical variation, a size 10 file was prebent and carefully introduced into the canal, and radiographs were taken from different angulations. Despite these diagnostic efforts, we were unable to definitively confirm the presence of an apical split."

## Case Overview

The patient presented with symptoms requiring root canal therapy. After thorough examination and radiographic assessment, endodontic treatment was initiated.

## Treatment Protocol

**Instrumentation**: Rotary file system used for canal preparation, with master apical file size 30, 0.04 taper.

**Irrigation**: Copious irrigation performed throughout the procedure using 5% sodium hypochlorite solution. EDTA was used for smear layer removal, followed by saline rinse, sodium hypochlorite reactivation, and a final saline rinse to ensure complete canal cleanliness.

**Obturation**: Lateral compaction technique performed using size 30, 0.04 taper gutta-percha as the master cone, supplemented with size 25 accessory cones and resin-based sealer.

## Notes

Treatment completed under supervision as part of clinical training.
