  - "Grade 1 subgingival margin"
learnings: "Utilized a saddle matrix for Grade 1 Deep Margin Elevation to create a supragingival seal.Transitioned to a sectional matrix for final contouring. This successfully raised the gingival floor to a supragingival level, creating a stable platform that allowed the sectional matrix to seat properly and achieve a predictable hermetic seal."
followUp: "The patient reported mild transient post-operative sensitivity immediately following the resolution of local anesthesia; however, symptoms diminished progressively over the subsequent days. Interproximal contacts were verified as anatomically correct and floss-tight."

## Case Overview

This case marked my first clinical Class II composite restoration, involving adjacent (back-to-back) surfaces. The primary objective was to eliminate caries while establishing a robust, cleansable contact area to prevent future food impaction and periodontal distress.

The primary challenge was the gingival depth of the distal box on tooth #20. This was classified as **Grade 1**, meaning the margin was subgingival but could be isolated non-surgically using a matrix. By employing a **Saddle Matrix** initially, I was able to perform a localized margin elevation, transforming a complex subgingival scenario into a manageable supragingival one suitable for a sectional matrix.

### Clinical Steps

1.  **Preparation**: Conservative box preparations were executed. Careful attention was paid to breaking the buccal and lingual contacts while preserving sound enamel to maximize bonding surface area.
2.  **Margin Elevation**: For the Grade 1 deep margin, a saddle matrix was used to lift the gingival floor. This provided the necessary seal that a standard sectional matrix could not initially achieve.
3.  **The "Sequential" Technique**: To ensure a predictable contact, I restored the teeth one by one. I fully restored the distal of #20 first, converting the cavity into a Class I. This created a solid "wall" to wedge against when restoring tooth #21.
4.  **Layering & Adaptation**: A thin layer of flowable composite was adapted to the gingival floor to prevent voids, followed by 2mm centripetal increments of nanohybrid composite to minimize polymerization shrinkage.

### Key Takeaways

- **Margin Management**: Using a saddle matrix for the initial "lift" is essential when a sectional matrix cannot otherwise reach the gingival floor. It ensures the most critical part of the restoration—the gingival seal—is hermetic.
- **Managing Sensitivity**: The patient experienced transient post-operative sensitivity. Proper communication of this to the patient is vital for post-op management.

### Reflections
